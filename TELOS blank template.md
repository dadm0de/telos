# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method of articulating a person's personal context so that they, and AI, can better understand them and help them improve. Pay attention to the items and the concepts here, and especially on how they work together.

The conceptual path is Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies —> Projects -> Journal. This means that any project you're doing can be mapped all the way back up to the problem(s) you're trying to solve. This gives you transparency and explainability in everything you're doing so you don't end up busy for days/months/years without being able to remember why you're doing what you're doing.

Other sections that aren't those core sections are additional context to support them.
